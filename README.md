## 🗂️ Project Structure

    src/
    ├── components/    # Your React components go here
    ├── lib/           # Logic, Hooks and functions go here
    ├── theme.tsx      # MUI theme configuration
    └── ...            # Other app-related files

### 🌈 Customizing the Theme

The default theme is defined in `src/theme.tsx`. Modify this file to change your app's look and feel with MUI’s powerful theming capabilities.

Explore the [MUI theming guide](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) to make it truly yours!

### 🗃️ State Management with Redux Toolkit

The store is pre-configured in `src/store` using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). A sample slice is provided to help you get started managing your app’s state. Access the state using the `useRtk` hook:

    import { useRtk } from './store';

    const data = useRtk(state => state.example);

Read more about [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to make your state management as seamless as possible.
